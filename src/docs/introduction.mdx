# Overview

Soul is an authentication provider and identity provider built for a federated social media eco-system.
It is meant to abstract some of the most important parts of a social media platform
(i.e. user connections, relationships and authentication) into a separate service so that it can be
shared across different social media platforms as long as they are using soul to authenticate and
build user connections.

## The Philosophy

We believe that connections and reputation are what defines a person, user or a soul in the cyberspace (maybe in the real world too ðŸ¤”).

This service attempts to federate some parts of a social media platform.
Newer platforms can be created and maintained without having to start from a fresh user base.
On the other hand, Soul members would not have to start from scratch in an entirely new social media platform as
they would be able to transfer their connections across all platforms which uses Soul to authenticate.
You'll be moving across different worlds/ dimensions while preserving your soul!

## TLDR

Don't let Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and Reddit monopolize the social media space, start your own platform!
