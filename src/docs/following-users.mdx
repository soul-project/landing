# Overview

Soul is not only an authentication provider for multiple platforms, it comes with social features
which allows you to follow / friend other members too (irregardless of platforms).

## Following other members

To follow other members, you simply have to login to your account from any platform and make a request
to the `/user-connections` endpoint.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.soul-network.com/v1/user-connections' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "from_user_id": <YOUR_USER_ID>,
    "to_user_id": <TARGET_USER_ID>
}'
```

> Note that the `from_user_id` field has to be your `user_id`
> obtained [here](/docs/getting-started#retrieving-my-account-information)

## Listing my connections

To list all of my follows / followers, you can utilize the `/user-connections/my-connections`
endpoint and specify the appropriate `connection_type`.

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.soul-network.com/v1/user-connections/my-connections?connection_type=following&num_items_per_page=10&page=1' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

## Listing a single connection by users

Alternatively, you could also retreive a single connection by using the `/user-connections/by-users`
endpoint and specifying the appropriate `from_user_id` (your `user_id`) and `to_user_id`.

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.soul-network.com/v1/user-connections/by-users?from_user_id=<FROM_USER_ID>&to_user_id=<TO_USER_ID>' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

### Connection types

- `follower`: Filter by members who are following you
- `following`: Filter by members who you are following
- `mutual`: Filter by mutual followers

## Remove an existing connection

To remove an existing follow, you can utilize the `/user-connections/<CONNECTION_ID>` endpoint where `CONNECTION_ID` is
defined by the user connection id which can be obtained by fetching from
[listing all connections](/docs/following-users#listing-my-connections)
or [listing a single connection by users](/docs/following-users#listing-a-single-connection-by-users).

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://api.soul-network.com/v1/user-connections/<CONNECTION_ID>' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```
