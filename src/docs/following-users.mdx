## Overview

Soul is not only an authentication provider for multiple platforms, it comes with social features
which allows you to follow / friend other members too (irregardless of platforms).

Connections to other users in the form of a `follower`, `following` or `mutual` relationship is managed
by the `/user-connections` suite. Everything is defined as a uni-directional user connection with a specified `from_user` and `to_user`.

> When designing this endpoint, generic terms were used instead of more platform-specific ones. This is to accommodate the different
> kinds of platforms that can be built with Soul.

### Follower

A `follower` type user connection refers to all user connections with the `to_user` field set to you.

### Following

A `following` type user connection refers to all user connections with the `from_user` set to you.

### Mutual

A `mutual` type user connection refers to all user connections where an opposite connection exists.
Basically, you have to be a follower of another member and you must follow that member to achieve a mutual connection status.

## Following other members

To follow other members, you simply have to login to your account from any platform and make a request
to the [create connection endpoint](https://soul.readme.io/reference/userconnectionscontroller_create).

> Note that the `from_user_id` field has to be your `user_id`
> obtained [here](/docs/getting-started#retrieving-my-account-information)

## Listing my connections

To list all of my follows / followers, you can utilize the
[list my connections endpoint](https://soul.readme.io/reference/userconnectionscontroller_findmyconnections)
and specify the appropriate `connection_type`.

## Listing a single connection by users

Alternatively, you could also retreive a single connection by using the
[get connection by users endpoint](https://soul.readme.io/reference/userconnectionscontroller_findonebyuserids)
and specifying the appropriate `from_user_id` (your `user_id`) and `to_user_id`.

### Connection types

- `follower`: Filter by members who are following you
- `following`: Filter by members who you are following
- `mutual`: Filter by mutual followers

## Remove an existing connection

To remove an existing follow, you can utilize the [delete connection endpoint](https://soul.readme.io/reference/userconnectionscontroller_remove)
where `CONNECTION_ID` is defined by the user connection id which can be obtained by fetching from
[listing all connections](/docs/following-users#listing-my-connections)
or [listing a single connection by users](/docs/following-users#listing-a-single-connection-by-users).
