## Overview

Soul is an authentication provider and identity provider built for a connected social media eco-system.
It is meant to abstract some of the most important parts of a social media platform
(i.e. user connections, relationships and authentication) into a separate service so that it can be
shared across different social media platforms as long as they are using soul to authenticate and
build user connections.

## The Philosophy

We believe that connections and reputation are what defines a person, user or a soul in the cyberspace (maybe in the real world too ðŸ¤”).

Although your account lives with us, your data doesn't!
Newer platforms can be created and hosted independently without having to start from a fresh user base.
On the other hand, Soul users would not have to start from scratch in an entirely new social media platform as
they would be able to transfer their connections across all platforms which use Soul to authenticate.
You'll be moving across different worlds/ dimensions while preserving your soul!

## Impartiality

Soul is an authentication provider and identity provider built for a connected social media eco-system.
Since we're just an identity provider, we're impartial towards what you post or do in the
different platforms integrating with Soul. Getting banned or excluded from one platform
does not mean you'll lose access to your Soul account or other platforms.

## TLDR

Soul is here to help you start your own social media platform with an existing user base! ðŸŽ‰

# Get started with Soul

## Registration

First, [register an account with us](https://login.soul-network.com/register) if you do not have an account yet.

> Follow the instructions presented on verifying your email to complete the registration process.

### Retrieving my account information

To retrieve more information about your account, you can use the [retrieve myself endpoint](https://soul.readme.io/reference/userscontroller_findme).

### Account customization

You can also customize your account by using the [patch myself endpoint](https://soul.readme.io/reference/userscontroller_updateme).

## Create a new platform

Create a new platform by using the [create platform endpoint](https://soul.readme.io/reference/platformscontroller_create)
and fill up the necessary details.

> Note that a valid redirect uri has to be specified, you may use `http://localhost:3000` for local development. This redirect uri will be used
> for logging users in to your platform.

### Platform customization

You can customize your platform by using the [update platform endpoint](https://soul.readme.io/reference/platformscontroller_update).

## Integrate with your own project

Soul uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users on third party platforms.
To provide Soul users access to your platform, check out our example app [twitter-clone](https://github.com/soul-project/twitter-clone).

This Twitter clone app uses nextauth with custom OAuth provider to authenticate Soul users to the platform. Once authenticate, users will be able to acecss
their profile and connections list from within the third party application.

Alternatively, you could try deploying a sample of your own twitter-clone using the
"Deploy" button on that [repository](https://github.com/soul-project/twitter-clone)
and it will deploy a sample app using Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsoul-project%2Ftwitter-clone%2Ftree%2Fmain&env=SOUL_PLATFORM_ID,NEXTAUTH_SECRET,NEXTAUTH_URL,DB_NAME)

> Do note that data on this test platform is not persistent
> unless an accompanying CouchDB instance is specified.
