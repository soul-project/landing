## Overview

Soul is an authentication provider and identity provider built for a federated social media eco-system.
It is meant to abstract some of the most important parts of a social media platform
(i.e. user connections, relationships and authentication) into a separate service so that it can be
shared across different social media platforms as long as they are using soul to authenticate and
build user connections.

## The Philosophy

We believe that connections and reputation are what defines a person, user or a soul in the cyberspace (maybe in the real world too ðŸ¤”).

This service attempts to federate some parts of a social media platform.
Newer platforms can be created and maintained without having to start from a fresh user base.
On the other hand, Soul members would not have to start from scratch in an entirely new social media platform as
they would be able to transfer their connections across all platforms which uses Soul to authenticate.
You'll be moving across different worlds/ dimensions while preserving your soul!

## TLDR

Don't let Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and Reddit monopolize the social media space, start your own platform!

# Get started with Soul

```

## Create a new platform

Create a new platform by navigating over to the [platforms page](/my-platforms) and clicking the "+" button. Fill up the form
and specify a valid redirect uri such as `http://localhost:3000` for local development.

### Platform customization

}'
```

> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reply-url

## Integrate with your own project

Soul uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate users on third party platforms.
To provide Soul users access to your platform, check out our example app [twitter-clone](https://github.com/soul-project/twitter-clone).

This Twitter clone app uses nextauth with custom OAuth provider to authenticate Soul users to the platform. Once authenticate, users will be able to acecss
their profile and connections list from within the third party application.

Alternatively, you could try deploying a sample of your own twitter-clone using the
"Deploy" button on that [repository](https://github.com/soul-project/twitter-clone)
and it will deploy a sample app using Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsoul-project%2Ftwitter-clone%2Ftree%2Fmain&env=SOUL_PLATFORM_ID,NEXTAUTH_SECRET,NEXTAUTH_URL,DB_NAME)

> Do note that data on that platform is not persistent
> unless an accompanying CouchDB instance is specified.
