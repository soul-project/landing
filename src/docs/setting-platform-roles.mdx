## Overview

Soul uses role-based access control to define who has access to configure the platform or promote a member to an admin.

## Roles

| role / permissions | login | configure | promote | demote |
| ------------------ | ----- | --------- | ------- | ------ |
| admin              | ✅    | ✅        | ✅      | ✅     |
| member             | ✅    | ❌        | ❌      | ❌     |
| banned             | ❌    | ❌        | ❌      | ❌     |

> More user roles will ba added in the future

## Setting a user role

Admins can set user roles for a specific user by making use of the
[set role for user endpoint](https://soul.readme.io/reference/platformscontroller_setplatformuserrole).
A list of roles (separated by commas) can be specified for a specific user to set his/her role.
