# Overview

Soul uses role-based access control to define who has access to configure the platform or promote a member to an admin.

## Roles

| role / permissions | login | configure platform | promote / demote members |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| admin              | ✅    | ✅                 | ✅                       |
| member             | ✅    | ❌                 | ❌                       |
| banned             | ❌    | ❌                 | ❌                       |

## Setting a user role

Admins can set user roles for a specific user by making use of the platforms users.
A list of roles (separated by commas) can be specified for a specific user.

```bash
curl --location --request PUT 'https://api.soul-network.com/v1/platforms/<YOUR_PLATFORM_ID>/users/<TARGET_USER_ID>?roles=admin,member' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR_PLATFORM_ID` and `TARGET_USER_ID` placeholders with your intended paramters.
